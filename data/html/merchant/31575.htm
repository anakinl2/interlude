!Fishermen's Guild Master Litulon:

Innadril is the best place I've ever seen for fishing!

There's great, warm weather in all four seasons!

Nature and the city co-exist beautifully here, wouldn't you agree?

There's no other place like it!

Innadril exists under the divine protection of Eva, the water goddess.

Now you know why they call it the city of water!
