!Fishermen's Guild Master Eindarkner:

This fishing resort is on the sea, not far from the kingdom of Elmore.

This has been a fishing resort since ancient times.

The lack of boat traffic means that the fishing around here is wonderful!

You'll find many rare species here that are found nowhere else!

Isn't it quiet and beautiful?

I hope you have a wonderful time!

If you need anything, please come see me.
