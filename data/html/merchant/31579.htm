!Fishermen's Guild Master Klaus:

I'm Klaus, a member of the Fishermen's Guild.

I'm the fishing specialist in these parts!

The region of Goddard is very mountainous and has many lakes brimming with high-quality fish!

Skilled fishermen come here seeking diversity and a challenge.

Some even fish in the hot springs to the north!
