!Fishermen's Guild Master Linnaeus:

Did you know?

Our king also likes fishing very much.

It is the pride of us Fishermen`s guild members.

The king possesses superb fishing skills to boot!

Oh, I am Linnaeus, Fishermen`s Guild member.

Aden Castle Town has many great places to fish.

When we have beautiful weather, why don`t you take some time off and go enjoy some fishing?

Won`t it give you the air of an aristocrat?

Ha Ha Ha Ha!
