!Dinn:

Are you looking for anything in particular?

Oh, please don't be fooled just because I'm a merchant at a small wharf; I have a wide selection for you to choose from.

If you see anything you can't live without, just say the word!

What, nothing that makes your eyes widen with longing?

Believe me, I can offer everything you'll find on the mainland.

Why don't you test me for yourself?
