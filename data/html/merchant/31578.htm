!Fishermen's Guild Master Hilgendorf:

Hi!

Welcome!

A nice day for fishing, isn't it?

My family has been active in the Fishermen's Guild for generations.

My expertise brought me here to Rune, where I teach the aristocrats how to improve their fishing technique.

Fishing here requires a lot of skill, and consequently, the best fishermen come here to pursue their hobby.
