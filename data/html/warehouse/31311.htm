!Warehouse Keeper Hugin:

Just because I spend my entire day here writing in ledgers doesn't mean that I'm bored!

Not at all!

While I keep the records of our inventory, I study the situation in the village.

I can even tell when something bad is about to happen...

von Hellmann, Van Hacken...

Remember to avoid these two names.

Sorry, that's all I can say!
