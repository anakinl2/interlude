!Warehouse Freight Keeper Daisy:

Allow me to introduce Hugin, Durin, and Runin... my dear younger siblings!

Even though we belong to the same guild, we were allowed to be dispatched here together...

This we owe to our beloved Uncle Donal!

Family ties should be treasured, don't you agree?

Your family should always come first in your mind!

Send yours some gifts!

Our freight service is at your disposal!
