!Master Themis:

Most so-called adventurers like you turn out to be worthless and weak!

I can't help but despise people like that!

So easy to kill it's hardly worth the effort!

You don't believe me?

Would you care to bet?

I swear, even before you can blink, I'll have my sword buried to the hilt in your ribs!
