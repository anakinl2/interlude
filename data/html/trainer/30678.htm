!Blacksmith Helton:

Who are you?

What do you want?

If you don't have a barrel of nice Dwarven beer I don't want to talk to you.

I thought the life of a blacksmith would be exciting, but it is all heating, hammering, bending and cooling.

I wish I could spend more time making shiny armor and sharp blades!
