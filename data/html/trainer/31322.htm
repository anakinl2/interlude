!Master Erian:

You adventurers are all the same!

Swing your sword a few times and suddenly you're a master swordsman!

I've got news for you!

You're nothing but a newbie!

You totally lack the discipline required of a warrior!

You've come to the right place!

We offer the very training you need!

Tighten up that flabby gut and raise your morale standards!
