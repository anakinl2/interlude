!Master Beryl:

Something's wrong here...

How can I describe it?

A dark, invisible power seems to be waiting to strike!

No matter how hard I try to ignore it, I can't shake this forboding sense of evil!

Maybe practicing my swordsmanship will make me feel better...

En garde!

Assume the position!

A duel!
