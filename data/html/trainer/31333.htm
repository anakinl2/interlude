!Magister Rumiel:

Indeed, I'm constantly amazed by the Humans' desire to write down everything they think of!

I suppose it's due to other inadequate memories...

I suppose, if I have the time, it wouldn't hurt to read these books...

But what if new books arrive before I finish reading these?

Is there a magic skill that will let me read faster?
