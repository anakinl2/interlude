!Blacksmith Rupio:

So nice to see you, young traveler.

I am Rupio, dispatched from the Black Anvil.

My brother Pushkin and I wish to make the best forge in Giran.

We couldn't work for a while because our tools hadn't yet arrived from the Dwarven Village in the north.

Finally they're here and we can begin our work.
