!Gatekeeper Valentina:

Why, hello.

I am Gatekeeper Valentina, dispatched from the Ivory Tower north of town.

Some people think that the Ivory Tower is planning to conquer the world, or that it's full of crazy people.

Of course there are also those who think that the Ivory Tower will save the world.

So then, what do you think?
