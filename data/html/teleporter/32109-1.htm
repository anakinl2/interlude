!Shilen's Stone Statue:

You know that in the past, Mother Shilen paid a great sacrifice to lock Sailren here.

Afterward, she created a stone likeness of herself and bestowed upon it the power to seal, making it a guardian of this place to ensure that Sailren remained imprisoned.

I am that stone statue of Shilen.

Mother Shilen also entrusted the power to seal to those who wield the sacred ax Gazkh.

I will only open the gate for those who have Gazkh and their friends.

When the seal is at its weakest, however, I allow a warrior to enter in order to minimize the sacrifice.
