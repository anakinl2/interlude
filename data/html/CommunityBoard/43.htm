Description of Event:

At  Fantasy Island, need to beat the pigs.

Of these, drop pieces of meat, which need to feed the crocodile.

Pigs have a fairly large quantity HP.

And if you are attacking them then they run away from you with a fairly high speed.

Drop with pigs below lvl 10 you will not, just drop rate is lowered if there is at least not a big difference in levels between the character and the mob.

The greater the difference in levels, the lower the drop rate.

The crocodile is on the same island.

While you meat feeds a crocodile, he attacks you.

For each piece of meat, crocodile gives an award in this case, CoL
