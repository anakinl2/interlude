!Grand Olympiad Manager:

When the Grand Olympiad games are over, the points of the Noblesse who participated are calculated.

If your point total exceeds 40, you may trade your points toward Noblesse Gate Passes.

Each Grand Olympiad point may be exchanged for 1,000 Noblesse Gate Passes, up to 2000 points.

Also, for a limited time only, a Hero or anyone assigned to become a Hero may recieve additional Noblesse Gate Passes equal to 100 Grand Olympiad Points.
