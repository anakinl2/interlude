!Pet Manager Annette:

People too easily ignore the benefits Striders have provided to civilization.

Think about it!

Because of Striders, battle tactics for siege warfares and large-scale clan wars have changed dramatically.

And transportation of goods between towns has become easier, helping accelerate the flow of trade.

Perhaps I should write a book, eh?

"The Impact of Striders on History of the Continent."

How's that for a title, eh?
