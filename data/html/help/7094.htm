!Record of the Guardian of the Mother Tree:

*The Elven Secret Hidden by the Guardians of the Mother Tree*

The guardians of the Mother Tree do not have an easy task.

The constant tension wears away at their composure, so they hide their feelings behind a mask.

Their frustations manifest themselves in a vicious hatred of all other races.

They are hopelessly cynical and pessimistic.

They frequently misunderstand the ritual sacrifice of the life of a guardian.
