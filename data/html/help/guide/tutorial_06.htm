Good work.

Now we will learn about clicking the mouse wheel.

Try clicking the *mouse wheel*.

By clicking the wheel, your viewpoint changes to a frontal view.

If you're already looking straight forward, clicking the wheel will switch directions so you're looking straight back.

The rearward view will help you in situations such as running away from a monster, or to determine how far you have traveled.

Also, it will help you maintain a uniform distance from other characters.
