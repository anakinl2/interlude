Speak to the *Paagrio Priests* of the Temple of Paagrio.

They will explain the basics of combat through quests.

You must visit them, for they will give you a useful gift after you complete a quest.

They are marked in yellow on the radar, at the upper-right corner of the screen.

You must visit them if you wish to advance.
