*Using the Mouse Wheel*
</center>

Good work.

Now you will learn about enlarging and shrinking the screen using the mouse wheel.

If you rotate the 

*mouse wheel* down, you enlarge the game screen.

Rotate the wheel up to reduce the screen.

The more you turn the wheel, the larger or smaller the screen becomes, but notice that there is a limit to how far you can go in either direction.
