*[Conversation with a Newbie Guide]*
</center>

Now, try talking with a *newbie guide*.

Move your mouse cursor over the newbie guide and *left-click*.

Then your mouse cursor will change into the shape of a balloon.

At this time, if you click the left mouse button again, the conversation will start.

If you move while following the direction of the arrow above your character, you will run into a newbie guide.

The guides will give you helpful instructions as well as useful gifts, so be sure to go meet with a newbie guide.
