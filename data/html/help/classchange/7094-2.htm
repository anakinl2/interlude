!Record of the Guardian of the Mother Tree:

Panacea was a product of just such a guardian's ritual.

He trained long and hard in martial arts techniques that allowed him to block all distractions from his mind.

However, the ritual is impenetrable in only one aspect, and leaves another aspect quite vulnerable.

Elven defenses can be overcome by psychological attacks such as Hate, but beware the guardian's swordsmanship.

The very fact that he was selected as a guardian of the Mother Tree is evidence of his superiority.

Use skills such as Ultimate Defense against him.
