!Khavatari Spirit Spellbook:

If you reach the limit while using the power of Ajirua, he'll materialize into a physical being and prevent you from ever using the fist of Khavatari!

Ajirua imparts a strong reflective ability in addition to *Burning Fist*, which fills your fist with the power of Paagrio, or the *Soul Breaker*, which can shatter a dead soul.

When Ajirua awakes, he becomes an evil being.

It's the duty of a grand Khavatari to slay him.
