*Death*

When a character of level 5 or above dies, some of its experience score (Exp) will be reduced and sometimes, with the exception of the weapons the character is currently equipped with, other items can be dropped.

This is not true of characters of level 4 or below who have never killed another character.

But the experience score (Exp) of a character at level 5 or above will be reduced when it dies, so please be careful.

In addition, if a character whose karma is 0 (you can check the karma value in the Status Windows, Alt+T) or if a character with 5 PK or less is killed during the battle (PVP) with another character, he or she will not drop any item.
