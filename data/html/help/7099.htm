!Khavatari Spirit Spellbook:

You who follow the path of Khavatari, fear Ajirua!

The teachings of Khavatari are purely logical.

Wind stokes and douses fire, and delivers it to the surface of the body.

Fire creates tremendous energy in the body, and allows learning of the powerful techniques of Khavatari.

But this method uses the power of Ajirua rather than Paagrio.

Be careful!
