!Ghost Chamberlain of Elmoreden:

Woooo!

I'm a ghost page of the ancient Elmoreden Empire!

I worked in the cemetery when I was a mortal being.

Now I'm here to help travelers going to the Elmoreden Cemetery.

My boss is in the Pilgrim's Necropolis.

He also helps people visit the cemetery.

Would you like to visit the cemetery of the Elmoreden empire?
