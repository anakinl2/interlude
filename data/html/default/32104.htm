!Vervato:

My name is Vervato; I retrieve the bodies of the poor souls who stand before the gates of death.

If you need a body, you've come to the right place!

Why, I wouldn't even shy away from a body summoning duel with the Elroki's best shaman.

Why?

Because I'm the best in the business!

Ah, but body summoning is only possible *if you or someone in your party is dead, if the body is located somewhere on this island and - most importantly - if you have enough money to pay my fee...*
