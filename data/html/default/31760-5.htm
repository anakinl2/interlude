!Adventurers' Guide Miss Queen:

Have you enjoyed your adventure so far?

Here is the weapon exchange coupon for travelers.

This coupon allows you to receive a grade D weapon from the warehouse of the Adventurer's Guild.

The coupon is non-transferable, and you are responsible for any loss or damage of it or the weapon.

You may only rent one weapon at a time, and if at any time before you reach level 25 you become unhappy with your choice, you may turn in the weapon for another coupon.

Good luck!
