!Asamah:

You must know which action to use when a Tyrannosaurus tries to cancel a capture skill.

When the beast *roars, shakes and writhes*, the appropriate capture skills to use are *kabokula, tapirawa and shabonoba*.

Watch each action of the Tyrannosaurus carefully and respond with the correct skill.

Remember that using a capture skill consumes both capture stones and MP.

Be sure to prepare enough of them both!

May Shilen bless your efforts!
