!Rift Post:

There are rules to the *Rift of Dimension*.

Where you go and what goes on inside there remains a mystery.

Once you get inside using the fragment, you'll only be able to stay for *about 40 minutes* before *the dimension shifts*.

Don't forget that.

If you don't like where you entered, you can *move just once*.

This decision must be made by *the party leader*.

You may not leave the party or allow anyone else to join your party while there, it's too dangerous.
