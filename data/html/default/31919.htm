!Ghost Chamberlain of Elmoreden:

Greetings!

I am a chamberlain of the ancient Elmoreden empire!

When I was a mortal being I worked at the cemetery of the Elmoreden empire.

Now I'm here, serving those who are traveling to the cemetery.

My assistant also assists such travelers.

He can be found near the entrance of Argos' Wall

Do you plan to visit the Elmoreden Cemetery?
