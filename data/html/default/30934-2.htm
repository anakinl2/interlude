!Collector Marsha:

My older brother Trumpin is also a collector.

He is very diligent and capable, although he does have a weakness for games of chance.

I have watched him gamble away all his savings.

Actually I saw him not too long ago.

We were running away from monster eyes and became separated.

He must still be somewhere in this crater...
