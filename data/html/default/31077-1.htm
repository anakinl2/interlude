Once you achieve a certain level of ability and experience you may advance to a higher class through the class transfer system.

To accomplish a class transfer you must fulfill a *class transfer quest*.

These quests can be undertaken by characters of level 19 and above.

After fulfilling the quest and achieving level 20 or higher, class transfer can be completed.

At the time of class transfer you will choose one of many available professions.

Once you made, your decisions is irreversible.

Make your choice carefully.
