!Asamah:

Do you already have the Elroki Trap?

Then I cannot give you the device again.

Perhaps you are unaware of it, but the device can only be manufactured by a handful of artisans who have mastered ancient skills passed down through the long years.

Were others, less skilled, to produce them, their quality would be noticeably less.

They might even endanger their users!

Please understand that the artisans put their very spirits and hearts into these devices, imbuing them with the very essence of the Elroki people.

How else could one can defend himself from a ferocious Tyrannosaurus using only this small weapon?
