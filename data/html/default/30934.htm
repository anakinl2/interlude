!Collector Marsha:

Merciful heavens, you startled me!

How did you sneak up on me like that?!

Anyway, it's nice to meet you!

I am Collector Marsha, an expert in exotic substances.

I am here searching for Starstones.

I had no idea this place was so dangerous!

Earlier I was nearly killed, and now I fear for my older brother!
