!Asamah:

If you have a trap, then you may use at least 3 types of capture skills.

You can only use a capture skill on the predatory Tyrannosaurus.

If you are capturing a Tyrannosaurus for the first time, you will use the *Kabokula* technique most among the three capture skills.

But you cannot completely capture this powerful predatory dinosaur with just one skill type!

At this point, watch the Tyrannosaurus' reactions and use the proper skill to maintain its state of captivity.

Nothing is a better teacher than your own experience, but since you have come all this way, I will tell you the traditional capture method of the Elkrohki.

Listen carefully.
