!Rift Post:

Welcome to the rift between the dimensions of time and space!

Where you're standing now is relatively safe.

It was created using all available resources.

By the way, I see that inner space where you're looking, and I must warn you...

We can't guarantee your safety!

Don't try to go there without our help!

Don't forget!

You'll have a better chance of returning alive if you take some friends with you.

What do you want to do?
