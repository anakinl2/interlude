!High Priest Orven:

You've done well to come to Aden Castle, which is the heart of the kingdom.

People say that this town is the cultural and religious center of the land.

If that is true, then this temple of light must be the center of faith for all that seek to serve Einhasad...

However, true holiness is something that manifests itself within everyday life.

The prayer of the peasant can touch the heart of the mother of light even more than the prayer of a high priest.

This place is really not any different than anywhere else.
