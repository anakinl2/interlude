!Grand Master Siegmund:

What do you think, young man?

Would you challenge the masters here just for the sake of learning a technique or two?

Their teaching methods may be somewhat rough, but they're all excellent teachers.

What happens if you get injured while receiving your training?

Don't worry!

The magister from the library across the road will chant a healing spell over you!

Recently I've noticed many talented young people in this place.

I'm very curious about what might happen here next...
