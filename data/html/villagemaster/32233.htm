!Grand Master Zoldart:

I am Grand Master Zoldart of the Kamael Guild.

Why, you look exhausted!

May I give you a piece of advice?

It is important for Kamael desiring class transfer to possess various abilities, but strong physical power is the most important factor.

You will have to undertake a number of difficult journeys to obtain the class transfer - how will you survive them when you are already as weak as a newborn foal?

Do not waste your energy - save it for when it will be needed.
