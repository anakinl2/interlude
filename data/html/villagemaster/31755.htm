!Grand Master Halaster:

Goddard Castle Town has produced many fine brave war heroes and also been a place of learning that's nurtured much intellectual thought.

We may look like country bumpkins, but looks can be deceiving...

Hard lives often lead to an unquenchable thirst for knowledge!

Life's lessons often bring greater power that helps in your day-to-day survival.
