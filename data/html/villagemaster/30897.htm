!Head Blacksmith Roman:

During the reign of Lionel Hunter, Innadril was never embroiled in wars.

He was an amazing statesman, capable of calming the wild havoc of Fafurion without mobilizing his army...

However those days are over.

That is obvious by the volume of war materials currently being produced...

There are dark days ahead...

Diligence and sincerity are no longer traits to be admired!
