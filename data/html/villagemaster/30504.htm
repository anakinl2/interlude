!Head Blacksmith Mendio:

I am Head Blacksmith Mendio of the Black Anvil guild, here in Gludin.

Without our Black Anvil guild, Human civilization would be primitive.

Can they wage a major war or perform castle sieges without us?

Not a chance!

Without our siege golems or weapons, those war-thirsty, haughty Humans would have to fight with their bare fists.

But wait, what brings you to the great Mendio?
