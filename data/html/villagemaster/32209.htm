!Grand Master Ferdinand:

Hello, my friend!

Isn't this place wonderful?

Ah, when I was young I had no time for the beauties of nature, but now that I am old I find Innadril scenery positively intoxicating.

I feel like a young boy on a picnic!

Oh dear... please forgive my babbling.

How can I help you?
