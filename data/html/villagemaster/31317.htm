!Head Blacksmith Lombert:

I don't recognize you.

Are you a traveler?

Just so you know... this is no longer the capital of Elmore.

Although you can still find plenty of natural resources, it's definitely not the same place it was before.

Frankly, it's gone to the dogs!

There's something seriously, deeply wrong with this place!
