!High Prefect Tushku:

Welcome to Heine, the city of water...

This is not a comfortable place for an orc such as myself.

All the sparkling buildings and Elves running about reeking of candy and cookies!

Yuck!

I am truly a fish out of water.

Ah, but we all have our burden to bear, am I right?

By the way, why were you looking for me?
