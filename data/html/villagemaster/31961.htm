!Head Blacksmith Newyear:

Do you know what happiest time for blacksmiths of the Schuttgart Territory is?

It's the end of each working day, when we we walk out of out shop and breathe in the cold fresh air.

After working long hours struggling with scorching heat and banging and clanging, it's relief.

We feel as if we are in paradise at that moment.

How many occupations offer such a reward?

I love my job as I could love no other.

I suppose you could say it was my calling in life... well, one of them.
