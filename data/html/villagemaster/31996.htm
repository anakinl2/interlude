!Grand Master Javier:

Greetings, my child!

Well met!

Forgive my exuberence, but I do love to meet an ambitious young Warrior such as yourself!

Ah, the travel and adventure!

The thrill of battle and the fellowship of soldiers.

If only I had kept to my training when I was younger...

Oh don't worry.

I know my job.
