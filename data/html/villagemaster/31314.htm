!Warehouse Chief Donald:

Although we Dwarves know the value of wealth better than anyone, friendship and trust are more important than wealth.

Boring story, right?

But listen!

A clan member you can trust, an alliance member with whom you share your goals... can never be bought with money!

If you have someone like that, they are more precious than any treasure in this world!
