!Warehouse Chief Natools:

This world is becoming a very dangerous place to be.

Prices are all going up because of the need for additional security.

Here in Innandril we are fortunate to have our wharf near the city, unlike our friends in Giran who must deal with the hazard and expense of long cargo routes...

Not to disparage Warehouse Chief Gesto, but we are much more efficient.
