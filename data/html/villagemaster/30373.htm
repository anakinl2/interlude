!Grand Master Ramos:

Hey there, my friend.

How are you doing?

I am Grand Master Ramos of the port village of Gludin.

No need for you to feel uneasy.

People like you I think of as part of my family.

I don't know if you've heard the rumors, but they say I'm quite popular among the young women of our village.

If you work hard, you could become quite popular yourself.

Ha ha ha...
