!Festival Guide:

*[Festival of Darkness - Bonus Information]*

*1. Awarding of Bonuses*

Bonuses are awarded to the victors of the competition.

They are given in the form of *ancient adena*.

Having the top score does not assure the bonus, the party must have also been victorious in battle.

If no party in a certain level is eligible for a bonus, the bonus is divided equally between the top scorers of the other levels.

*2. Amounts of Bonuses*

All parties that participate in the festival must pay a fee.

These fees are distributed as bonuses.

Naturally, the more parties that participate in the festival, the greater the bonues will be.

*3. Bonus Periods*

Since some parties challenge the Festival of Darkness more then others, bonuses are not determined until the competition is complete, during the seal validation period.

The leader of the highest-scoring victorious party of each level must visit the oracle to recieve the reward.
