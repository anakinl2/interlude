*[What is the Festival of Darkness?]*

The Festival of Darkness is a magical ritual held to awaken the power of the seven seals.

To successfully perform this ritual, you must defeat many monsters during a short time, collect their blood and bring it to me.

Blood shed in mortal combat has strong powers...

We try to awaken the sleeping seals by concentrating that strength.
