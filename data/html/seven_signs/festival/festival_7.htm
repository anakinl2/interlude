!Festival Guide:

*[Return to Village]*

If you wish, I'll send you back to the village from where you came.

Oh, be careful!

If you are in possession of a blood offering that you have obtained during the festival, it will disappear as soon as you return to the village.

And, if you wish to return to the oracle from the village, speak with the priest in the village.

Do you really wish to return to the village?

[npc_%objectId%_Quest _1103_OracleTeleport|Yes, I want to return to the village.]
