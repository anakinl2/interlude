*[Seal of Avarice]*

The Seal of Avarice bestows the following benefits:

*Ownership of the Necropolises:*

The Lords of Dawn have exclusive rights to the eight Necropolises.

In case of a tie, entry is no longer exclusive.

*Meeting with Lith:*

The door to the Forbidden Sanctum opens and we finally meet Lilith, the Abyssal Mother.

She is our greatest enemy, sleeping in the Saints Necropolis.

*Commerce with Merchant of Mammon:*

You can do business with the Merchant of Mammon in the Necropolises.

They accept payment in ancient adena, and have many fine, rare articles.
